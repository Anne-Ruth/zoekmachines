# zoekmachines

This repository is a searchengine using Flask and Elasticsearch for a "goeievraag" dataset. 

To load the data make sure you have Elasticsearch 6.4.2 and a file called data with the goeievraag csv's, having this you can run load_data_fast.py. This will automatically load data in elasticsearch.

Run the search.py script to use the searchengine on localhost:5000
